# Signal-generator
ATMega328 produces different waveforms.

It is possible to generate square, sawtooth and sine waveforms within a range of frequencies 1 - 100 Hz. The frequency and signal is chose by using a 4 x 4 keypad. A PWM signal is generated and then plug into a low pass filter so the signal is smoothed.
